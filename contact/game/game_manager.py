    A protocol describing the way how and which methods of async-based
    WSConsumer should be executed from sync-based GameManager.
    Generally GameManager (a.k.a brain or model from MVC) shouldn't know about
    WSConsumer (a.k.a communicator or controller from MVC) and its duties, but
    due to the specificity of the game WSConsumer should somehow know about
    exclusive game actions in a separate order. Hence even though brain does
    not wanna know about the communicator, it should signal about these specific
    actions. That's why this protocol implements the backwards connection to
    communicator (or in different words it helps to delegate the responsibility
    of brain to its delegate â€“ communicator).
    That could be needed when users should have receive offers not strictly
    after the game event, but in a different time (e.g. delayed offers regarding
    to event, or offer in the middle of the event)
